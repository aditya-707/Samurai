                        <h2>Samurai Armor</h2>
                        <p>The iconic armor of the samurai wasn't just for protection—it was a symbol of status and artistry. Each piece was meticulously crafted not only for battlefield functionality but also to inspire awe and intimidation.</p>
                        <p>The typical samurai armor (gusoku) consisted of a helmet (kabuto), face mask (menpo), shoulder guards (sode), chest armor (do), and thigh guards (haidate). These components were often lacquered in vibrant colors and adorned with clan symbols (mon).</p>
                        <p>Samurai armor evolved over centuries, reflecting changes in warfare tactics and technologies. Despite being made primarily of small metal plates laced together with silk or leather cords, the armor was surprisingly lightweight and allowed for considerable mobility.</p>

                        <h3>Rise of the Samurai</h3>
                        <p>During the Heian period, the samurai emerged as provincial warriors employed by the nobility to protect their estates and interests. The term "samurai" derives from the Japanese verb "saburau," meaning "to serve."</p>

                        <h3>Kamakura Shogunate</h3>
                        <p>The first samurai government was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo. The warrior class gained political power, marking the beginning of feudal Japan. Zen Buddhism began influencing samurai philosophy during this period.</p>

                        <p>This era saw constant warfare between competing samurai clans. The Ōnin War (1467-1477) led to the Sengoku period or "Age of Warring States," with rapid development in weapons, tactics, and castle architecture.</p>

                        <p>Japan began the process of unification under powerful daimyō Oda Nobunaga, and later Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Samurai armies grew larger, and European firearms transformed battle tactics.</p>

                        <p>The Tokugawa Shogunate ushered in a 250-year period of peace. Samurai transformed from battlefield warriors to bureaucrats and administrators. The strict code of bushido was formalized during this time.</p>

                        <p>The samurai class was abolished during Japan's rapid modernization. The Sword Ban of 1876 prohibited wearing swords in public, effectively ending the samurai era. Many samurai rebelled, culminating in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877.</p>
